# Iosevkata 

A `PragmataPro` styled `Iosevka` variant with

1. A fixed spacing, no ligature. I once liked ligature, but it's distracting.
2. A higher underscore. To make underscore-connected characters feels connected, like `Menlo`.
3. A lower hex asterisk. To place it at the center of the line, like `Menlo`.
4. An oval-dottet zero. PragmataPro's diamond shaped zero is too sharp for me.
5. A few decorations mimicking `mononoki`, for 'B', 'D', 'P' and 'R'.
